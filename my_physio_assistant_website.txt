  ✓ **MODAL IMPLEMENTATION (Latest)**:
    - Created Modal.tsx component for reusable modal popups
    - Updated Footer.tsx with modal state management
    - Converted legal documents to modal popups:
      • Privacy Policy (7 sections - GDPR compliant)
      • Terms of Service (6 sections - Legal disclaimers)
      • MHRA Compliance (5 sections - Non-medical device status)
    - Removed full-page legal sections from App.tsx
    - Significantly reduced page length and improved UX
    - Modal features: ESC to close, click outside to close, prevents body scroll

  Legal & Compliance Documents:

  All three compliance documents are accessible via footer modal popups:
  - Privacy Policy: Full GDPR/UK data protection compliance
  - Terms of Service: Legal terms, disclaimers, and usage restrictions
  - MHRA Compliance: Non-medical device status and safety controls

  Benefits of modal approach:
  - Cleaner main page (removed ~3 large sections)
  - Better user experience (access without scrolling through)
  - Mobile-friendly
  - Industry-standard pattern for legal documents
  - Legally compliant (easily accessible)
