To enable the "Block service account API key bindings" policy, which enforces the iam.managed.disableServiceAccountApiKeyCreation constraint, you'll need to set the organization policy to "Enforced" (or "On") at the appropriate level (Organization, Folder, or Project).

Here's how you can enable this policy using the Google Cloud console:

Navigate to Organization Policies: In the Google Cloud console, go to the IAM & Admin section, and then select Organization Policies .
Select Resource Scope: On the Organization Policies page, use the project/folder/organization selector at the top to choose the resource (organization, folder, or project) where you want to apply this policy.
Find the Policy: In the filter box, type "Block service account API key bindings" or search for the constraint ID iam.managed.disableServiceAccountApiKeyCreation . Select the policy from the list.
Manage the Policy: On the policy details page, click Manage policy .
Override Parent Policy: In the "Policy source" section, select Override parent's policy .
Add or Edit Rule:
If there isn't an existing rule, click Add a rule .
If there's an existing rule, you may need to edit it.
Set Enforcement: For the rule, set the Enforcement option to On . This will enable (enforce) the policy.
Save Policy: Click Done for the rule, and then click Set policy to apply your changes.
Once enabled, any attempts to create API keys bound to service accounts within the scope of this policy will be denied. This is a recommended security best practice.

Therefore, if you are still unable to create an API key, it is not because this specific organization policy is blocking it , as the policy is currently "Not enforced." There must be another reason.

You should investigate other potential causes for not being able to generate an API key, such as:

Missing IAM permissions: Do you have the iam.serviceAccountKeys.create permission in the project where you're trying to create the key?
Other organization policies: While this specific one is not enforced, there might be other organization policies that are blocking key creation (though this is the most common one for service account API keys).
Project configuration issues: Check if there are any other settings or quotas preventing API key creation.
