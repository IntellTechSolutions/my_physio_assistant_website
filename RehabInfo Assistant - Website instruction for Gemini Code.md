  📋 PRODUCT OVERVIEW

  What is RehabInfo Assistant?

  RehabInfo Assistant is an intelligent chatbot that provides post-consultation rehabilitation  
  information to physiotherapy patients. Built with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  
  technology, it delivers accurate, source-cited answers from verified clinical resources  
  including NHS, NICE, BNF, CSP, and MHRA guidance.

  Unlike generic health chatbots, RehabInfo is designed specifically for the UK physiotherapy  
  sector with strict MHRA compliance, ensuring educational support without crossing into  
  medical advice or diagnosis.

  ❓ FAQ

  For Patients

  Q: Is this a replacement for my physiotherapist?  
  A: No. RehabInfo Assistant is an educational tool to support your recovery between  
  appointments. Always follow your physiotherapist's specific advice and attend scheduled  
  follow-ups.

  Q: Is my data private and secure?  
  A: Yes. We do not store personal health information. Queries are educational only and  
  logged anonymously for safety monitoring. Phase 5 will add optional patient accounts  
  with full GDPR compliance.

  Q: What if I have an emergency symptom?  
  A: Our system detects red flag symptoms (e.g., severe pain, numbness, bladder issues)  
  and immediately advises you to call 999 or visit A\&E. Never delay emergency care.

  Q: How do I know the information is accurate?  
  A: All responses cite verified sources (NHS, NICE, BNF, CSP, MHRA) and are clinically  
  reviewed by qualified physiotherapists. Every answer includes source citations.

  Q: Does it cost anything to use?  
  A: That depends on your clinic. Many clinics offer RehabInfo Assistant free to their  
  patients as part of their service. Check with your physiotherapist.

  For Clinics / Physiotherapists

  Q: Is this MHRA compliant?  
  A: Yes. RehabInfo Assistant is designed as an educational tool (not a medical device)  
  with strict safety boundaries: no diagnosis, no prescriptions, mandatory disclaimers,  
  and full audit logging.

  Q: Can I customize the knowledge base?  
  A: Enterprise plans include custom protocol upload (e.g., your clinic's specific exercise  
  programs). Basic/Professional plans use our curated NHS/NICE knowledge base.

  Q: How do you ensure information quality?  
  A: All documents are clinically verified by qualified physiotherapists, version-tracked,  
  and sourced from Tier 1-2 providers (NHS, NICE, BNF, Gov.uk, CSP, MHRA).

  Q: What happens if a patient asks about diagnosis?  
  A: The system detects blocked topics (diagnosis, prescriptions, legal advice) and politely  
  redirects patients to consult their physiotherapist or GP in person.

  Q: Can I see what my patients are asking?  
  A: Yes (Phase 5). The clinician dashboard shows aggregated query trends and individual  
  patient session logs (with patient consent), helping you identify common concerns.

  Q: What if the system gives incorrect information?  
  A: Full audit logging allows rapid identification and correction. Clinical verification  
  ensures accuracy upfront. Any errors reported are fixed within 24-48 hours.

  For Investors / Founders

  Q: What's your competitive advantage?  
  A:  
  1\. UK physiotherapy-specific (not generic health chatbot)  
  2\. MHRA compliance built-in from day one  
  3\. RAG architecture (accurate, source-cited responses)  
  4\. Clinician-controlled knowledge base  
  5\. Clear regulatory path (educational tool, not medical device)

  Q: How big is the market?  
  A: UK physiotherapy market: £1.2B+ annually, 3,000+ private clinics, 350+ NHS trusts.  
  Expanding to other Allied Health professions (OT, podiatry) increases TAM to £3B+.

  Q: What's the path to profitability?  
  A: SaaS model with £99-£499/month per clinic. At 100 clinics (achievable Year 1),  
  ARR \= £240K. At 1,000 clinics (Year 3), ARR \= £2.4M. Cloud costs \~15% of revenue,  
  gross margin \>80%.

  Q: What are the regulatory risks?  
  A: MHRA classification as educational tool (not medical device) is low risk. We maintain  
  strict boundaries: no diagnosis, no prescriptions, mandatory disclaimers. Legal review  
  completed pre-launch.

  Q: What's the exit strategy?  
  A: Potential acquirers: EMR/EHR providers (EMIS, SystemOne), telehealth platforms  
  (Babylon, Push Doctor), health insurers (Bupa, AXA), or physiotherapy franchises  
  (The Physiotherapy Centre, Six Physio).

  Q: How defensible is this?  
  A: Network effects (more clinics → more data → better responses), regulatory moat  
  (MHRA compliance non-trivial), clinician trust (verified by peers), switching costs  
  (integrated into clinic workflow).
